English | [中文](README.zh.md)

**Plugin list** tab for Web Settings — the single home for browsing and controlling Host plugins (the sidebar Plugins entry was removed in favor of this one place). The browser plugin registers one localized `settings.plugins.tab` contribution with id `all`; the Plugins section owns the navigation entry and tab chrome. It performs no Remote read during plugin activation. Selecting the tab for the first time mounts it and lazily calls `ctx.remote.pluginInventory.list()` through [`api-remotes`](../../api/remotes/README.md).

The tab renders a searchable two-column catalog of compact disclosure cards. Each collapsed card uses the short module name as its title and a small effective-enablement tag; enabled entries also show a colored root-fiber status dot. Expanding one card reveals its Loader-tree entry id without a redundant field label, the effective configuration and, for enabled entries, Cordis status, plus rich metadata injected from each package manifest: description, tags, developer, and category. An expanded card ends with an Enable/Disable button that calls `ctx.remote.pluginInventory.toggle()` and refetches the snapshot so the new Loader phase is visible in place. Disabled entries omit the redundant unmounted runtime state. The entry id remains the React key, disclosure identity, detail value, and an additional search target; it is never classified by string shape. Loading, empty, no-match, and generic failure states stay local to the mounted component, and a failed read can be retried without exposing transport details. The registration uses `ctx.slots.inject()`, so it follows late tab declaration, redeclaration, locale changes, and teardown without importing the section owner.

## Model Experience

None, as this package only visualizes a Host-owned deployment snapshot in browser Settings and registers nothing model-facing.

#### KV Cache effect

None; this package neither assembles nor sends a provider request.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

- **One snapshot per Settings mount or retry** — the tab does not subscribe to Loader changes or automatically refetch after reconnect; switching tabs preserves the current snapshot, while reopening Settings obtains a new one.
- **No provenance or grouping** — local search does not add source grouping or current-browser activation diagnosis.
